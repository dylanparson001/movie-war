# Movie War!
Website for tracking Movie War League 

## Rules: 

    Players rank upcoming movies, users gain points based on the box office performance of the movie and where they ranked each movie.
    Games are split by the year, there are 10 rankings, users can rank any movie that is being released that year.
    Whoever ends the year with the most points wins. Box office stats are updated every Monday morning to calculate the previous weekend.

## Ranking System: 
    Scores are multiples of every hundred thousand the movie earns. 
    For example: 
        If you rank the Mario Movie at #1, and it earns 500,000 at the box office, you will earn 5 points while if someone ranked
        it as # 3 they would earn 30 points.
